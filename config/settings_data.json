              "faq_content": "<p>No doubt, some &ldquo;expert&rdquo; has told you that you need to place a light that produces natural sunlight over your bird to keep it healthy. In reality, there is no such thing as a light bulb that can simulate natural sunlight. No light, including mine, emits something that directly affects the health of a bird. That being said, M&amp;M lights do have benefits:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Regular and proper light:<\/strong> The most significant health benefit from M&amp;M lights is that they make it possible for you to provide your bird with a consistent and appropriate amount of light, in hours, per day. The fancy word for it is photoperiod. Photoperiod triggers numerous bird hormones.. If you own a species of bird that originated near the equator, its hormones will not respond properly to short winter days in North America. A bird&rsquo;s hormones may also react negatively to a different photoperiod. For example, if you are turning the lights off at 7 p.m. during the week and 11 p.m. on weekends. Birds benefit from a consistent 12-hour day and 12-hour night schedule<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Concentrated light:<\/strong> Birds love light. If your bird&rsquo;s only source of light is from a window across the room or an overhead light on the ceiling, then cage bars, play tops, and toys often block a lot of that light. M&amp;M lights mount on top of or inside the birdcage and focus all of the light into the cage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. A Broad spectrum of light:<\/strong> M&amp;M Lights have a broader spectrum of visible light waves than most bulbs manufactured for birds. While there are no comprehensive studies to cite, the feedback I get from customers and my own experience suggest that most birds respond very favorably to it. Some of the feedback that I have received includes<\/p>\n<p>comments like:<\/p>\n<p>● My screamer stopped screaming.<\/p>\n<p>● My parrot eats healthy foods he wouldn&rsquo;t eat before.<\/p>\n<p>● I&rsquo;ve had the best breeding season ever since I added your lights.<\/p>\n<p>● My birds go back into their cage during the day to sit under it.<\/p>\n<p>The cause of these benefits is unclear but is likely due to more dedicated light for your bird, having a consistent photoperiod, or more natural-looking surroundings thanks to the spectrum produced by the light.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forthebirdsdvm.com\/pages\/hormonal-behavior-in-pet-birds-therapeutic-remedies\" title=\"https:\/\/www.forthebirdsdvm.com\/pages\/hormonal-behavior-in-pet-birds-therapeutic-remedies\">Further reading<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>",

They are specifically for breeders or other people who have many cages stacked on top of or next to each other. The lights plug into each other in series and are powered by one large power adapter. They also have a more industrial look.<\/p>\n<p>Pet lights are designed for use on a single cage and have a more attractive housing that you will not mind having in your living room.

They are made for people who are interested in rapid growth, such as nursery and marijuana growers, so they mostly contain the wavelengths for photosynthesis. A healthy plant can thrive without a grow light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Further Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about artificial light!<\/p>\n<p>The current trend is to insist that your bird needs a light that simulates natural sunlight. Much emphasis is put on UVB, which produces Vitamin D3. However, this is just marketing hype from unscrupulous light manufacturers trying to sell you something. Unfortunately, most Avian Vets and virtually all &ldquo;internet experts&rdquo; repeat the false information without substantiating it.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, there is no such thing as a light bulb that can simulate natural sunlight. You can&rsquo;t turn a rock into a zebra, and you can&rsquo;t turn electricity into sunlight.<\/p>\n<p>Most lights that are marketed for birds and claim to have UV are repackaged reptile bulbs and are dangerous for your bird. Many well-meaning bird owners have accidentally caused their pets to develop cataracts or go blind due to the misuse of these bulbs.<\/p>\n<p>If you are worried about Vitamin D3 production, it can be easily supplemented in a bird&rsquo;s diet.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some interesting facts about artificial light:<\/p>\n<p>● Full Spectrum is a word made up for marketing. It has no scientific definition and, therefore, cannot be measured. It is generally used to refer to a light that contains all of the electromagnetic waves in the visible and UV spectrum that the sun produces at noon on a cloudless day.<\/p>\n<p>● No artificial light contains as many electromagnetic wavelengths as the sun; it&rsquo;s simply beyond the laws of physics to produce. For decades, independent testing labs have measured so-called full spectrum bulbs and found little to no difference between their output and that of ordinary bulbs.<\/p>\n<p>● Most bulbs marketed for birds that claim to be full spectrum and have both UVA and UVB are selling the same bulb you can purchase at Walmart for $2.<\/p>\n<p>● Lights that contain UV can do damage to your bird&rsquo;s sensitive eyes.<\/p>\n<p>● The sun&rsquo;s &ldquo;visible Spectrum&rdquo; output varies from 1,000K to 30,000K throughout the day and only reaches &ldquo;Full Spectrum&rdquo; or 5600K at noon on a cloudless day during the summer months.<\/p>\n<p>● The sun&rsquo;s UV output is only present from zero to six hours per day. Its wavelength varies, and its intensity ranges from zero to maximum depending on many factors such as geographic location, weather, time of day, and shade. Artificial lamps emit UV at the same intensity all the time.<\/p>\n<p>As an engineer who only trusts scientific data, it makes my skin crawl that the term &ldquo;full spectrum&rdquo; has been twisted and misused by the industry. I call my lights Full Spectrum because the term has become ingrained in the minds of bird owners.<\/p>",

              "faq_content": "<p>Dr. John Ott, a pioneer in time-lapse photography and amateur botanist, made up the phrase &ldquo;full spectrum&rdquo; to describe a light bulb that contained all of the electromagnetic wavelengths in the visible spectrum, as the sun does at noon. It has no scientific definition, and cannot be measured&mdash;it is more of a concept than something that exists in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 1970s, Dr. Ott noticed that the plants he was photographing in time-lapse grew and bloomed at different rates depending on what light he was using. That led to the discovery that plants perform photosynthesis at a higher rate at specific wavelengths of artificial light. Years later, he wrote a book theorizing that all living organisms would benefit from full spectrum lighting, and the concept is now ingrained into the minds of people.<\/p>\n<p>While Dr. Ott was a great photographer and self-promoter, his conclusions about the benefit of full spectrum light were not based on science. His theories were never accepted in the scientific community, and there were no peer reviews of his studies. Yet, just as mothers yell at their children to put a hat on to avoid catching a cold even though scientists have known since the 1940s that colds are caused by contracting a virus, people will insist that birds need a full spectrum light to be healthy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn more\/external links:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>*Link to article that you are going to write*<\/p>\n<p>*Link to video that I am going to finish* Publication of scientific research on the effect of UVB on parrots A comprehensive study on the false claims of full spectrum lighting<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/doi\/full\/10.1098\/rspb.2010.1100\" title=\"https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/doi\/full\/10.1098\/rspb.2010.1100\">Publication of scientific research on the effect of UVB on parrots<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lrc.rpi.edu\/programs\/nlpip\/lightinganswers\/fullspectrum\/benefits.asp\" title=\"https:\/\/www.lrc.rpi.edu\/programs\/nlpip\/lightinganswers\/fullspectrum\/benefits.asp\">A comprehensive study on the false claims of full spectrum lighting<\/a><\/p>",
