Many of a bird’s hormones are triggered by photoperiod, which in turn prompt certain behaviors such as nest-building and migration. Dr. Fern Van Sant, owner and primary veterinarian at the For the Birds clinic, explains the importance of photoperiod: <br></span></p><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-469464d0"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-c1aa4694">“If there is one single positive change that pet bird owners can make, it is returning the bird to a regularly recurring photoperiod. Whether in the wild or captivity, most birds demonstrate a remarkable periodicity to their days. Restoration of a regular recurring day and night cycle usually results in a happier and healthier companion bird. Birds have in their brains a finely tuned, light sensitive pineal gland. This gland is likely the mechanism by which birds set their circadian rhythm.”  &nbsp;<br></span></p><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-51722813"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-36ee5172">Each bird species is different and benefits from particular photoperiods.

If your bird’s only source of light is from a window across the room or an overhead light, then cage bars, play tops, and toys often block a lot of it. In the pictures below, the customer has a double French door only inches to the left of the cage but without artificial lighting, the cage remains dim. You can clearly see the difference that a cage mounted light makes. </span></p><picture class="sc-psedN fLDHlO pf-54de52b0" data-pf-type="Image"><source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after.jpg?v=1589123098"><source media="(min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199px)" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after.jpg?v=1589123098"><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px)" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after_800x508.jpg?v=1589123098&resized"><source media="(max-width: 767px) and (orientation: portrait)" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after_400x254.jpg?v=1589123098&resized 1x, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after_850x850.jpg?v=1589123098&resized 2x"><source media="(max-width: 767px) and (orientation: landscape)" srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after_400x254.jpg?v=1589123098&resized 1x, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after.jpg?v=1589123098 2x"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/0085/7903/t/4/assets/pf-7228132b--tom-before-and-after.jpg?v=1589123098"></picture><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-179aba8c"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-a33f179a"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">The importance of light color in the bird room. </span></span></h3><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-02bc5a26"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-b60c02bc">Back in the 80s, when I was an engineer at a company that made dentist drills, our product engineers added a filter to the drill’s lights that increased the output to the 6000K range. When the new product was demonstrated, I was amazed at how much easier it was to see details inside of the mouth and how much more natural it looked. It was a huge success because it made the dentist’s job easier. That is a perfect example of the effect that light color has.  
<br>
<br>Photographers have known this for decades, and a professional can talk about light color for longer than you would want to stand there and listen. That’s because correct light color is paramount to how objects appear. However, it has never been proven that light color has a direct, physiological effect on the health of birds or humans.  
<br>
<br>Mental wellbeing is a different story; there are plenty of scientifically backed studies that show positive mental effects on humans from lights that contain wavelengths that make objects appear more natural. The belief is that the brain expels less energy trying to interoperate objects. It is my personal belief, based on years of feedback from customers, that the same is true with birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-244ee53e"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-7a7d244e">UVA waves in the bird room </span></h3><p data-pf-type="Paragraph2" class="sc-pkvvt cbrLgP pf-0b3d9cbe"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-be040b3d">Humans (trichromats) view the world with around one million colors. Birds (tetrachromats) are able to see around 100 million colors. Experts theorize that it helps birds find food easier and identify healthier food. They also speculate that birds see many colors in fellow bird’s plumage that we can’t see, assisting in identification and finding mates. 
<br>
<br>How this actually affects caged birds is hotly disputed and highly understudied. Most of the online claims that come from lighting manufacturers and resellers are highly suspect, but there are enough independent studies that show positive effects to convince caged bird breeders to take a serious look at UVA. At the writing of this article, there are very few published studies. However, that is changing rapidly. For example, check out this 2013 study done for zoos that found a link between aviary housed bird behavior and UVA. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will UVA benefit my birds?</span> The short answer is that while much more research still needs to be done, there is evidence of a link between positive bird behavior and UVA. 
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will UVA improve my bird’s health? </span>There is no scientific evidence that there is a physical health benefit to caged birds by adding UVA light.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Should I add UVA to my bird room?</span> If you have the means (boat loads of extra cash) to add UVA then absolutely do it. But here is the caveat, you should not think of UVA as a “silver bullet” to make you birds healthier, happier, and more productive because it isn’t. Many years ago, I built UVA lights and conducted an experiment. I set up eight identical cages, four with UVA and four without. Over four years (eight breeding sessions of six months each), I bred Gouldian Finches, Strawberry Finches and Canaries. If there were any benefits of the UVA, they were so slight that they were unnoticeable. This experiment is what led me to not add UVA to my lights, as the benefits would not justify the extra cost.

Guess what? The UVB waves from these lamps dissipate long before 24” (refer to the last item under “Full Spectrum Lighting Facts”).
